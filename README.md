# RestApiAutomation
This is a project to demonstrate rest api automation via using Rest-Assured library. It has basic get and post api tests. Wiremock is used to generate post api test. Also, Lombok is used to generate getters, setters and toString method without writing the boilerplate code.

# Getting Started :
Below mentioned instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

# Prerequisites :
IntelliJ Idea                                                                                                                                                                                  
Java 8                                                                                                                                                                  
TestNG                                                                           

Please follow the below mentioned steps to get a working repo :                                                       
Clone the repository via ssh/http using URL -- https://github.com/navsinghoberoi/RestApiAutomation

# Running the tests :                                           
Automated tests : To run the automated tests, follow the steps -

Go to RestApiAutomation/src/test/java folder.                                                       
To run the testcases, execute TestNG.xml file.

# Built With :
Java -- Programming Language            
Maven -- It is a build automation tool                    
Git -- It is a distributed version-control system                               
TestNG -- It is a testing framework                                      
WireMock -- It is a simulator for HTTP-based APIs                                           
Lombok -- It generates getter, setters method at compile time without having the need to write all boilerplate code

# Add test cases :
Remember below mentioned points before creating new api tests -- 
a) Adding GET method tests --                                                           
To add tests, go to RestApiAutomation/src/test/java/ZipCodeApi_GetRequestTests folder and create a new file             
b) Adding POST method tests --                                                              
To add tests, go to RestApiAutomation/src/test/java/ZipCodeApi_PostRequestTests folder and create a new file
